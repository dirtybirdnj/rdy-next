Mat Gilbert is a software engineer and creative living in Huntington VT with his wife Monica and their cat Dusty.

He really likes computers, gadgets, anything technology related. He once had a job where robots were used to "hand write" messages and it showed him the possibilities of CNC machines.

Now he's working on building his own robot that can do drawings of people without being connected to the internet.

He wants to share the journey, the tools, the plans and the adventure with you. Thanks for reading.
